Estimation Methods for Dynamic Treatment Regimes
================================================

This section contains methods for estimating (heterogeneous) treatment effects,
even when treatments are offered over time and the treatments were chosen based on a dynamic
adaptive policy. This is referred to as the dynamic treatment regime (see e.g. [Hernan2010]_)
