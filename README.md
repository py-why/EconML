# Introduction 

The [ALICE project](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/alice/) at Microsoft Research is 
aimed at applying Artificial Intelligence concepts to economic decision making.  The Microsoft EconML 
package is part of that project, providing a toolkit that combines state-of-the-art machine learning 
techniques with econometrics in order to bring automation to complex causal inference problems.  This 
toolkit is designed to measure the causal effect of some treatment variable(s) `t` on an outcome 
variable `y`, controlling for a set of features `x`.  For more information about how to use this package, 
consult the documentation at https://econml.azurewebsites.net/.

# Getting Started

For developers, you can get starting by cloning this repository.  We use 
[setuptools](https://setuptools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) for building and distributing our package.
We rely on some recent features of setuptools, so make sure to upgrade to a recent version with
`pip install setuptools --upgrade`.  Then from your local copy of the repository you can run `python setup.py develop` to get started.

# Running the tests

This project uses [pytest](https:docs.pytest.org/) for testing.  To run tests locally after installing the package, 
you can use `python setup.py pytest`.

# Generating the documentation

This project's documentation is generated via [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/index.html).  To generate a local copy
of the documentation from a clone of this repository, just run `python setup.py build_sphinx`, which will build the documentation and place it
under the `build/sphinx/html` path.

The reStructuredText files that make up the documentation are stored in the [docs directory](docs/); module documentation is automatically generated by the Sphinx build process.
