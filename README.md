</a> EconML: A Python Package for ML-Based Heterogeneous Treatment Effects Estimation
</h1>

**EconML** is a Python package for estimating heterogeneous treatment effects from observational data via machine learning. This package was designed and built as part of the [ALICE project](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/alice/) at Microsoft Research with the goal to combine state-of-the-art machine learning 
techniques with econometrics to bring automation to complex causal inference problems. The promise of EconML:

* Implement recent techniques in the literature at the intersection of econometrics and machine learning
* Maintain flexibility in modeling the effect heterogeneity (via techniques such as random forests, boosting, lasso and neural nets), while preserving the causal interpretation of the learned model and often offering valid confidence intervals
* Use a unified API
* Build on standard Python packages for Machine Learning and Data Analysis

One of the biggest promises of machine learning is to automate decision making in a multitude of domains. At the core of many data-driven personalized decision scenarios is the estimation of heterogeneous treatment effects: what is the causal effect of an intervention on an outcome of interest for a sample with a particular set of features? In a nutshell, this toolkit is designed to measure the causal effect of some treatment variable(s) `T` on an outcome 
variable `Y`, controlling for a set of features `X, W` and how does that effect vary as a function of `X`. The methods implemented are applicable even with observational (non-experimental or historical) datasets. For the estimation results to have a causal interpretation, some methods assume no unobserved confounders (i.e. there is no unobserved variable not included in `X, W` that simultaneously has an effect on both `T` and `Y`), while others assume access to an instrument `Z` (i.e. an observed variable `Z` that has an effect on the treatment `T` but no direct effect on the outcome `Y`). Most methods provide confidence intervals and inference results.

For detailed information about the package, consult the documentation at https://econml.azurewebsites.net/.

  <summary>First Stage Model Selection (click to expand)</summary>

EconML's cross-fitting estimators provide built-in functionality for first-stage model selection.  This support can work with existing sklearn model selection classes such as `LassoCV` or `GridSearchCV`, or you can pass a list of models to choose the best from among them when cross-fitting.

```Python
from econml.dml import LinearDML
from sklearn import clone
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor
from sklearn.linear_model import LassoCV
from sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV

cv_model = GridSearchCV(
              estimator=RandomForestRegressor(),
              param_grid={
                  "max_depth": [3, None],
                  "n_estimators": (10, 30, 50, 100, 200),
                  "max_features": (2, 4, 6),
              },
              cv=5,
           )

est = LinearDML(model_y=cv_model, # use sklearn's grid search to select the best Y model 
                model_t=[RandomForestRegressor(), LassoCV()]) # use built-in model selection to choose between forest and linear models for T model
```


</details>

### Inference

Whenever inference is enabled, then one can get a more structure `InferenceResults` object with more elaborate inference information, such
as p-values and z-statistics. When the CATE model is linear and parametric, then a `summary()` method is also enabled. For instance:

  ```Python
  from econml.dml import LinearDML
  # Use defaults
  est = LinearDML()
  est.fit(Y, T, X=X, W=W)
  # Get the effect inference summary, which includes the standard error, z test score, p value, and confidence interval given each sample X[i]
  est.effect_inference(X_test).summary_frame(alpha=0.05, value=0, decimals=3)
  # Get the population summary for the entire sample X
  est.effect_inference(X_test).population_summary(alpha=0.1, value=0, decimals=3, tol=0.001)
  #  Get the parameter inference summary for the final model
  est.summary()
  ```
  
  <details><summary>Example Output (click to expand)</summary>
  
  ```Python
  # Get the effect inference summary, which includes the standard error, z test score, p value, and confidence interval given each sample X[i]
  est.effect_inference(X_test).summary_frame(alpha=0.05, value=0, decimals=3)
  ```

  ```Python
  # Get the population summary for the entire sample X
  est.effect_inference(X_test).population_summary(alpha=0.1, value=0, decimals=3, tol=0.001)
  ```
  ![image](notebooks/images/population_summary.png)
  
  ```Python
  #  Get the parameter inference summary for the final model
  est.summary()
  ```
  ![image](notebooks/images/summary.png)
  
  </details>
  

### Policy Learning

You can also perform direct policy learning from observational data, using the doubly robust method for offline
policy learning. These methods directly predict a recommended treatment, without internally fitting an explicit
model of the conditional average treatment effect.

<details>
  <summary>Doubly Robust Policy Learning (click to expand)</summary>

```Python
from econml.policy import DRPolicyTree, DRPolicyForest
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor

# fit a single binary decision tree policy
policy = DRPolicyTree(max_depth=1, min_impurity_decrease=0.01, honest=True)
policy.fit(y, T, X=X, W=W)
# predict the recommended treatment
recommended_T = policy.predict(X)
# plot the binary decision tree
plt.figure(figsize=(10,5))
policy.plot()
# get feature importances
importances = policy.feature_importances_

# fit a binary decision forest
policy = DRPolicyForest(max_depth=1, min_impurity_decrease=0.01, honest=True)
policy.fit(y, T, X=X, W=W)
# predict the recommended treatment
recommended_T = policy.predict(X)
# plot the first tree in the ensemble
plt.figure(figsize=(10,5))
policy.plot(0)
# get feature importances
importances = policy.feature_importances_
```

# For Developers

You can get started by cloning this repository. We use 
[setuptools](https://setuptools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) for building and distributing our package.
We rely on some recent features of setuptools, so make sure to upgrade to a recent version with
`pip install setuptools --upgrade`.  Then from your local copy of the repository you can run `pip install -e .` to get started (but depending on what you're doing you might want to install with extras instead, like `pip install -e .[plt]` if you want to use matplotlib integration, or you can use  `pip install -e .[all]` to include all extras).

## Pre-commit hooks

We use the [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) framework to enforce code style and run checks before every commit. To install the pre-commit hooks, make sure you have pre-commit installed (`pip install pre-commit`) and then run `pre-commit install` in the root of the repository. This will install the hooks and run them automatically before every commit. If you want to run the hooks manually, you can run `pre-commit run --all-files`.

## Finding issues to help with

If you're looking to contribute to the project, we have a number of issues tagged with the [`up for grabs`](https://github.com/py-why/EconML/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22up+for+grabs%22) and [`help wanted`](https://github.com/py-why/EconML/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22help+wanted%22) labels. "Up for grabs" issues are ones that we think that people without a lot of experience in our codebase may be able to help with, while "Help wanted" issues are valuable improvements to the library that our team currently does not have time to prioritize where we would greatly appreciate community-initiated PRs, but which might be more involved.

## Running the tests

This project uses [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/) to run tests for continuous integration.  It is also possible to use `pytest` to run tests locally, but this isn't recommended because it will take an extremely long time and some tests are specific to certain environments or scenarios that have additional dependencies.  However, if you'd like to do this anyway, to run all tests locally after installing the package you can use `pip install pytest pytest-xdist pytest-cov coverage[toml]` (as well as `pip install jupyter jupyter-client nbconvert nbformat seaborn xgboost tqdm` for the dependencies to run all of our notebooks as tests) followed by `python -m pytest`.

Because running all tests can be very time-consuming, we recommend running only the relevant subset of tests when developing locally.  The easiest way to do this is to rely on `pytest`'s compatibility with `unittest`, so you can just run `python -m unittest econml.tests.test_module` to run all tests in a given module, or `python -m unittest econml.tests.test_module.TestClass` to run all tests in a given class.  You can also run `python -m unittest econml.tests.test_module.TestClass.test_method` to run a single test method.

## Generating the documentation

This project's documentation is generated via [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/main/index.html).  Note that we use [graphviz](https://graphviz.org/)'s 
`dot` application to produce some of the images in our documentation, so you should make sure that `dot` is installed and in your path.

To generate a local copy of the documentation from a clone of this repository, just run `python setup.py build_sphinx -W -E -a`, which will build the documentation and place it under the `build/sphinx/html` path. 

The reStructuredText files that make up the documentation are stored in the [docs directory](https://github.com/py-why/EconML/tree/main/doc); module documentation is automatically generated by the Sphinx build process.

## Release process

We use GitHub Actions to build and publish the package and documentation.  To create a new release, an admin should perform the following steps:

1. Update the version number in `econml/_version.py` and add a mention of the new version in the news section of this file and commit the changes.
2. Manually run the publish_package.yml workflow to build and publish the package to PyPI.
3. Manually run the publish_docs.yml workflow to build and publish the documentation.
4. Under https://github.com/py-why/EconML/releases, create a new release with a corresponding tag, and update the release notes.

# Contributing and Feedback

This project welcomes contributions and suggestions.  We use the [DCO bot](https://github.com/apps/dco) to enforce a [Developer Certificate of Origin](https://developercertificate.org/) which requires users to sign-off on their commits.  This is a simple way to certify that you wrote or otherwise have the right to submit the code you are contributing to the project.  Git provides a `-s` command line option to include this automatically when you commit via `git commit`.

If you forget to sign one of your commits, the DCO bot will provide specific instructions along with the failed check; alternatively you can use `git commit --amend -s` to add the sign-off to your last commit if you forgot it or `git rebase --signoff` to sign all of the commits in the branch, after which you can force push the changes to your branch with `git push --force-with-lease`.

This project has adopted the [PyWhy Code of Conduct](https://github.com/py-why/governance/blob/main/CODE-OF-CONDUCT.md).
